This version: April 2019 (first GIT version)

In this folder you find a slightly modified version of the Janssen
reimplementation [1] that allows to create images of the data usage and also
files for validation that have been used to cross-validate this
reimplementation.

The most important aspect is the routine "findfarmandsettlement", which is
depicted in the SVGs in the way I understand it from the code of Janssen and
have implemented in my model.
