#Model Schelling Segregation Model (1d discrete)

##Description
This is a simple implementation of the Schelling Segregation Model in it's one
dimensional version (1971), discretesised.

The set of agents populates a 1d line with discrete number of "patches".
Agents are blue or red. They prefer to have neighbours with equal colour,
but not too strongly. The parameter "tolerance" in [0,1] defines the fraction
of agents with a different colour that are O.K.

They look in their neighbourhood spanning "distance" patches to the left and
right to see if they are content. They are content as long as the fraction of
neighbours with a different colour is at most equal to the "tolarance" level.

The number of agents is strictly less then the number of patches. If an agent is
not content with its situation, it moves to the closest place where it would be
content if such a place exists. In cases of ambiguity between options, a random
decision takes place. The agent does not anticipate the behaviour of other
agents.

The simulation stops when no agent wants to move, either because they are all
content or because they do not find a new position that would make them content.

##Parameters and Variables

Control:
[V]	Scheduler		: Represents the "Updating Scheme"
[V]	Initialise	: Initialisation of the Model	

Global (Sensitivity) Parameters :
[P] xn  			  : Length of the line		(integer>>3)
[P] yn  			  : y-dimension of the space (integer>>3)
[P] wrapping  	: Wrapping 		(0: off, 1: left, 2: right, >=3: left & right)
[P] fracAgents	: relative number of agents compared to xn (0..1)
[P] fracBlue		: relative number of blue agents from total (0..1)
[P] tolerance		: the tolerance level (homogeneous, 0..1)
[P] distance		: size of the neighbourhood, to left and right (1, ... xn)


Agent:
[P] Colour			:	The colour of the agent (red=1/blue=5, decided by initialisation)
[F] locFracOther: Fraction of other coloured agents in the local neighbourhood. (take care of empty places!)
[F] Content			: 1.0 - the agent is content with the situation, 0.0 - it is not.
[V] Move				: Decide if the agent wants to move. If yes, move. Value: 0-no move, 1-move

Patch:
[F] isOption     : Dummy, based on the asking agent tells if it is an option or not.

Monitor / Output:
( lattice				: graphical representation, only windowed, singular modus)
[V] fracMove 		:	fraction of agents that move.
[V] fracContent	:	fraction of agents that are content with their situation
[V] dissimilarity	: measurement of segregation (dissimilarity index)
