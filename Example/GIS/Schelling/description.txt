A set of T. Schelling segregation models

The Schelling Seggregation models:
- Schelling1971-discrete
- Schelling1971-continuous (to do)
- Schelling1978
- Schelling-withPajek

The original model is a 1d line with continuous space. It is implemented in a
1d discrete version and a 1d continous version.

The 1978 model is a discrete 2d model with a Moore Neighbourhood.

Schelling-withPajek is very much the same as the 1978 version, but with added
support to produce svg's. The resulting .paj file can, for example, be loaded
with Pajek or PajektToSVG, see mrvar.fdv.uni-lj.si/pajek/ for infos.
