Model GIS Example (ver. 1.0)

This is a simple toy example model to show how the new GIS module works. 
Initially there are 20 agents with different colours that spawn at random points on the map.
The agents attributes are Strength (initially 1) and NewSpawn (initally 2). The agents move randomly on the map, colouring the patch they just visited in their colour. For each point in strength they can move one step further. If they encounter another agent with a different colour in the same patch, they fight. The one agent with the higher Strength wins, reducing the strength of its counterpart by one and adding one to his own Strength. Whenever the strength reaches 0, an agent dies. Whenever the Strength equals NewSpan, the agent spawns a copy of itself at the same position on the map, but with Strength 1 and NewSpawn 2 (initial values). At the same time, NewSpawn is doubled (i.e. an agent needs to double strength before spawning a new one). Once all colours are defeated, the game ends and the simulation stops.

Controls:
Wrap : Define with a bitcode if wrapping is allowed
		There are 2^4 options. We use a bit-code (0=off):
    0-bit: left     : 0=0 1=1
    1-bit: right    : 0=0 1=2
    2-bit: top      : 0=0 1=4
    3-bit: bottom   : 0=0 1=8
    Simply add the numbers to define the wraping. E.g. 5 -> wrap left and top.
  
x_dim and y_dim : Define the size of the grid
RandomiseOrder: 0 - off (LSD default), 1 - on (Agents act in random order)

--------------------------
General Info:

Objects can have double-valued positions with x in [0,xn).
If you copy an agent by using ADDOBJ_EX, the position is also copied and the new agent registered in the map.
If you delete an agent, it is also deregistered from the map. If it is the last element in the
map, then the map is deleted.
