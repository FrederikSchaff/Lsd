Development Test Models

This is a growing (intention) group of models that test the way LSD works.
This is not the same as unit-testing, but it serves the same deeds:
- Validate that LSD does what it should
- Provide Use-Cases (abstract) that show how the code works.

This group is work-in-progress.
