To use Subbofit.exe in Windows, Cygwin must be installed and included in the PATH environment variable.

This version of Subbofit was compiled for Windows 64-bit and requires Cygwin64. Please check LSD Readme.txt file for installation instructions.

If already using LSD in 64-bit mode, Cygwin64 should be already installed and configured in the PATH variable.
