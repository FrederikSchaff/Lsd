<p class=MsoTitle>Glossary of LSD Model Elements</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A model in LSD is composed by a hierarchical collection of <a
href="#_Object">Objects</a> organized in an inverted tree structure and each
defined as containing elements as <a href="#_Variables">Variables</a>, <a
href="#_Parameters">Parameters</a> and/or <a href="#_Ancestor_and_Descendants">descending
Objects</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Though a <a href="#_Models'_Technical_Representation">LSD
model</a> is rather intuitive, it is crucial to understand the difference
between the content of the model in terms of structure (i.e., the definitions
of the different elements) and of data (number of element instances/copies and
initial values). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The structure of the model is defined by the modeler (see
menu <span class=Cdigo><a href="menumodel.html"><span style='color:gray;
text-decoration:none'>Model</span></a></span>) and cannot be changed (in
general) without modifying also the <a href="#_Equations">Equations</a> of the
model, which requires a (minimal) programming expertise. Instead, once a model
is built and a structure defined, the data of a model can be modified by any
user, being guided by user-friendly interfaces (menu <span class=Cdigo><a
href="menudata.html"><span style='color:gray;text-decoration:none'>Data</span></a></span>).
At last, the fully configured model can be easily simulated (menu <span
class=Cdigo><a href="menurun.html"><span style='color:gray;text-decoration:
none'>Run</span></a></span>). </p>

<h1><a name="_Object"></a>Object </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is the basic entity of a LSD model. It represents an
entity of the virtual reality simulated in the model. It is composed by: a <a
href="#_Label">label</a>, <a href="#_Flag_for_Computations">flags for computation
options</a>, some (or even none) <a href="#_Variables">Variables</a>, some (or
even none) <a href="#_Parameters">Parameters</a>, and <a href="#objstr">ancestor
and descendant Objects</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An Object is defined when the model is built and its
definition cannot change during a simulation run. A specific configuration of a
model can implement as many copies, or instances, of a specific Object type,
and this number can also vary during a simulation run. Each instance of an
Object replicates exactly the same structure of any other instance of the same
Object type, but, of course, may assign different numerical values to the
elements it contains (i.e., <a href="#_Variables">Variables</a> and <a
href="#_Parameters">Parameters</a>). The descendants, as well, must share the
same structure for each instance of an Object type, though their number (of
instances) can vary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>See more details about Objects in the <a
href="LSD_faqs.html#object">FAQ</a>.</p>

<h2><a name=objlab></a><a name="_Label"></a>Object label </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Object label is the name used to identify an Object
type. The label must be unique for each Object type, irrespective of its
position in the model structure (i.e., the inverted tree), and, so, no other
Object, Variable or Parameter in the model may share the same label. The label
is a string of up to 99 characters which cannot contain non-alphanumeric
symbols, like spaces (‘<span class=Cdigo> </span>’), slashes (‘<span
class=Cdigo>/</span>’ and ‘<span class=Cdigo>\</span>’), tabs, end-of-string or
other special characters. In LSD, labels are case sensitive. </p>

<h2><a name=flagcomp></a><a name="_Flag_for_Computations"></a>Object flags for computation
options</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Normally, these options can be ignored, since they are
useful only to increase the speed of the <a href="LSD_faqs.html#simulationrun">simulation
runs</a> under certain circumstances. For huge models, it can be the case that
some Objects are used only for storing data. If there are very many instances
of these Objects it is possible to force the simulation to ignore them during
the simulation time step, so that they are not (uselessly) explored for
updating Variables. It is safe to leave the default option (on).<a
name=variables></a></p>

<h1><a name="_Variables"></a>Variables </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Variables are the main LSD element and are used to store
numerical (real) values obtained as result of the computation of an Equation.
An Equation normally uses the values of <a href="#_Parameters">Parameters</a>
and other Variables contained in the model. Variables’ values are not
restricted to the contemporaneous ones (same current time <i>t</i>) but can
also involve lagged values (from time <i>t</i> = <i>t</i> – <i>h</i>, <i>h</i>
= 1, 2,…). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A Variable is defined by its <a href="#varlab">label</a>,
the <a href="#_Lags">number of lags</a> and the <a href="#equations">associated
Equation</a>. See more details in the <a href="LSD_faqs.html#variable">FAQ</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since LSD is based on the object-oriented programing (OOP) paradigm,
it is not recommended (or natively supported) the use of vectors and matrices
of Variables. In order to use many instances of a given Variable (or Parameter),
similarly to elements of a vector/matrix in the traditional paradigm, in OOP it
is required the creation of several instances of the <a href="#_Object">Object
type</a> containing the Variable or Parameter of interest. Note that this means
the whole content of the Object (all its elements) will be replicated in many
instances. If the modeler finds out that part of the replicated Object is
useless for the model (or demand too much memory), this may indicate that the <a
href="LSD_faqs.html#modelstructure">model structure</a> can be better designed
and the model more likely needs to be revised (e.g., splitting the data two
different Object types). </p>

<h2><a name=varlab></a><a name="_Variable_label"></a>Variable label </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Variable label is the name used to identify a Variable.
The label must be unique for each Variable, even if contained in different
Objects, and, so, no other Object, Variable or Parameter in the model may share
the same label. The label is a string of up to 99 characters which cannot
contain non-alphanumeric symbols, like spaces (‘<span class=Cdigo> </span>’),
slashes (‘<span class=Cdigo>/</span>’ and ‘<span class=Cdigo>\</span>’), tabs,
end-of-string or other special characters. In LSD, labels are case sensitive. </p>

<h2><a name=lags></a><a name="_Lags"></a>Number of lags of a Variable</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each Variable is assigned a numerical value at each time
step. In most cases, some Variables in their computation need to use the past
value(s) of itself or other Variables. Therefore, all the Variables having
their past values used in the computation of an <a
href="#_Variable_associated_Equation">Equation</a> must have such “lagged”
values (i.e., computed in previous time steps) saved. So, when creating a
Variable, modelers have to inform LSD up to how many “lags” the Variable values
are required.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If a Variable is defined as having no (zero) lags, it does
not need any initial value set at the beginning of the simulation, since its
value can be computed at the beginning of the <a
href="LSD_faqs.html#simulationrun">simulation run</a> (<i>t</i> = 1). However,
in case a Variable has lagged values used in any Equation in the model, users
need to assign numerical initial values to it. Initial values are used during
the initial time steps of the simulation run while the lagged values cannot be
computed yet (e.g., the value at <i>t</i> = 0 during time <i>t</i> = 1). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>See also how to <a href="menudata_init.html">set initial
values</a> and the <a href="LSD_faqs.html#simulationrun">FAQ</a> about the
management of time in a simulation run. </p>

<h2><a name=equations></a><a name="_Equations"></a><a
name="_Variable_associated_Equation"></a><a name="_Equation_associated_to"></a>Equation
associated to a Variable</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The values for Variables are computed at each time step
using the associated Equation code. The code of all the Equations in a model is
contained in an <a href="LSD_faqs.html#equationfile">equation file</a>, which is
compiled by <a href="LSD_faqs.html#lmm">LMM</a> in order to obtain a <a
href="LSD_faqs.html#model">LSD model program</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The code for an Equation can be any legal <a
href="LSD_faqs.html#c">C++</a> piece of code plus the LSD defined <a
href="LSD_macros.html">macros</a> or <a href="LSD_functions.html">functions</a>.
Note that the Equations can also be used to perform other tasks besides
providing the (required) numerical values to Variables. For example, they can
create or destroy Objects, sort sets of Object instances, overwrite previously
computed values of Variables or modify the values of <a href="#_Parameters">Parameters</a>.
Since it is regular C++ code, an Equation can also be used to access external
packages and libraries. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The code for an Equation must be written as the computations
to be executed during a generic time step. During a <a
href="LSD_faqs.html#simulationrun">simulation run</a>, LSD takes care of
updating the different Variables in order to respect the <a
href="LSD_faqs.html#scheduling">precedence order</a> implied by the set of
difference equations used to define the Equations' code. That is, to compute
the equation <i>x<sub>t</sub></i> = f(<i>y<sub>t</sub></i>), the system will
automatically compute the equation for <i>y</i> before the equation for <i>x</i>,
because the updated value of <i>y </i>is necessary for calculating <i>x</i>.
If, instead, the equation is like <i>x<sub>t</sub></i><sub> </sub>= f(<i>y<sub>t
</sub></i><sub>-1</sub>), then the system may compute <i>x</i> before <i>y</i>,
because Variable <i>y</i> has its value for the previous time step already
stored. Warning: <a href="LSD_macros.html">LSD macros</a> to overwrite the automatically-calculated
values must be used with extreme care because they may inhibit the automatic
updating order control. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>See the <a href="LSD_faqs.html#equation">FAQ</a> for further
details. <a name=parameters></a></p>

<h1><a name="_Parameters"></a>Parameters </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>A Parameter is one of the elements of an <a href="#_Object">Object</a>.
It must have a numerical (real) value assigned and it is not modified by LSD
during the <a href="LSD_faqs.html#simulationrun">simulation run</a>. Therefore,
a Parameter is basically a special kind of Variable without an Equation or lags
with a (more likely) constant numerical value attached. It also requires a
naming label (same restrictions to the <a href="#_Variable_label">naming of
Variables</a> apply).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Though LSD does not explicitly compute new values for
Parameters during a simulation run, the Equation’s code for any Variable can
overwrite the value of a Parameter at any time step. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to run a simulation, it is necessary that each
Parameter (contained in every instance of all Objects) have a numerical value assigned
before the simulation is run. See also how to <a href="menudata_init.html">set
initial values</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>See more details in the <a href="LSD_faqs.html#parameter">FAQ</a>.</p>

<h1><a name="_Ancestor_and_Descendants"></a>Ancestor and descendants </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>A model in LSD can be considered as a collection of <a
href="#_Object">Objects</a> organized in a <a
href="LSD_faqs.html#modelstructure">hierarchical inverted tree structure</a>.
That is, each Object has one and only one parent/ancestor (from which it directly
descends) and, possibly, a set of son/descendant (brother) Objects. The structure
of the model must be designed on the basis of the meaning attributed by the
modeler to the Objects. In general, an Object is defined as a descendant of
another Object if it can be interpreted as a component of its parent Object. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Technically, the hierarchy tree is used by LSD at run time
to allow the <a href="#_Equation_associated_to">Equation</a> for a <a
href="#_Variables">Variable</a> contained in an Object to easily find the values
of other Variables and <a href="#_Parameters">Parameters</a> contained in the
same or different Objects. For example, consider a model that contains many
instances of an Object named <span class=Cdigo>Market</span>, from each of
which descends many Object instances of type <span class=Cdigo>Firm</span>. If Equations
for Variables contained in <span class=Cdigo>Firm</span> needs to retrieve
values in <span class=Cdigo>Market</span>, each son <span class=Cdigo>Firm</span>
can directly use the (single) values stored in their parent <span class=Cdigo>Market</span>
without ambiguity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Equation’s code, modelers refer to other Variables or
Parameters of the model by simply using their labels, without any form of
indexing like the ones used for vectors or matrices. However, of course, in
general there may be many instances of any Variable or Parameter contained in
multiple brother-Object instances. In order to choose which instance to use,
LSD exploits the hierarchical structure in a precise manner: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>A value to any element is requested to the same specific Object
where the Equation for the requesting Variable is located.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If this Object contains the requested element, the value for it
is returned.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If it does not contain the requested element, the request is then
sent to its descending Objects, if any, in the same order they are listed or
were created.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If one son Object contains the requested element, the value for the
first one found (first instance) is returned.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In case no descending Object contains the requested element, the
request is sent to its parent Object</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If the parent Object contains the requested element, the value
for it is returned.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If the parent does not contain the requested element, the request
is sent to its own parent Object (the grandparent of the original requestor
Object).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-18.0pt'><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Strategy
in steps 6 and 7 is repeated until the <span class=Cdigo>Root</span> object is
reached.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LSD Object search strategy has the property that, if the
model is well defined, modelers can write the Equations' code by simply using
the label of the necessary Parameters or Variables, despite the number of
instances they can replicated in the model and where they are located. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, consider a model where an Object named <span
class=Cdigo>Market</span> is defined as having one Parameter called <span
class=Cdigo>Price</span> and several instances of a son Object type named <span
class=Cdigo>Firm</span>. If the model data define <span class=Cdigo>Market</span>
as being replicated in several instances (e.g., an economy with many markets),
each of them will be created as having a set of descending (brother) <span
class=Cdigo>Firm</span> Objects. If the Equations for the Variables in <span
class=Cdigo>Firm</span> request the value of <span class=Cdigo>Price</span>,
each of them will refer to the same instance of <span class=Cdigo>Price</span>
contained in their own instance of the parent <span class=Cdigo>Market </span>Object.
So, the modeler does not have to worry for specifying which prices among the
several markets are to be considered by any firm present in the model,
irrespective to which particular market it may pertain. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LSD also provides ways to overrule the default Object search
mode. Suppose that, for an extension of the above example, the modeler wants <span
class=Cdigo>Firm</span>'s to choose the <span class=Cdigo>Market</span> on
which they operate. Therefore, <span class=Cdigo>Firm</span> will not be any
longer a “component” of <span class=Cdigo>Market</span>, so each time <span
class=Cdigo>Price</span> is used in the Equations an algorithm to decide which <span
class=Cdigo>Market</span> instance to refer to must be created. In this situation,
a better model structure could be having the set of <span class=Cdigo>Firm</span>
Object instances defined as “parallel” to the set of <span class=Cdigo>Market</span>
Objects. </p>

<h1><a name="_Models'_Technical_Representation"></a>Models' split representation

model structure and data (in the <a href="LSD_faqs.html#modelsetting">model

by <a href="LSD_faqs.html#lmm">LMM</a> to produce the <a
href="LSD_faqs.html#model">LSD model program</a>. The model structure and the
associated data are instead loaded dynamically from a <a
href="LSD_faqs.html#modelsetting">model configuration</a> (many may coexist).&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under this split arrangement, the resulting simulation
program is as fast as any (well designed) regular C++ program. However,
differently from most traditional simulation programs, the model configuration becomes
extremely flexible because every value (and many different setups) of the model
can be easily changed (and maintained). Still, as in any compiled coding approach,
in order to change even slightly the Equations of a model, the recompilation of
the changed parts is required before the simulation can run again. To keep the
process simple, LMM becomes most of this process transparent to the modeler. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The information on the structure of the model and on the
initial values used for the simulations is kept together in the configuration
file(s) (<span class=Cdigo>.lsd</span> extension). These files should never be edited
manually, as they are created and used automatically by LSD. See more details in
the <a href="LSD_faqs.html#modelsetting">FAQ</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the <a href="LSD_windows.html#browser">LSD Browser</a>
loads a configuration file, it recreates in the computer memory the structure
of the corresponding model. The in-memory structure includes all the required initial
values for the corresponding elements as well the other needed simulation
settings. When running the simulation, each Variable in every Object instance
of the model is connected to the piece of code corresponding to its Equation.
In other words, each LSD model program is executable software which contains
the code of the Equations for a given set of Variables. It can load any LSD model
configuration associated to that particular model, but not a configuration from
a different model which contains other Variables or Parameters. Note that the Equations’
code embedded in a LSD model program may contain code for computing variables not
used in a particular model configuration (this “extra” code will simply be
never used). Still, it is not possible to run a LSD model program using a
Variable whose Equation’s code was not included when the program was compiled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The split arrangement allows, for all LSD simulation programs,
containing any set of Equations (even no Equation at all), to load and edit the
structure of any model (but not to run it). Only when the simulation is
actually run, the possible inconsistency among the Variables in the model
configuration and the Equations in the model program will issue an error. </p>
