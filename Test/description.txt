Test models.

In this place you will find models that test the LSD language.

The models herein serve two issues. Firstly, they are kind of a living 
documentation of how certain language features (especially Macros) work.
Secondly, they include specific test-logs, which can be used to confirm 
that the language does what it is suppossed to do. This allows automatic
regression testing (using a simple tool caleld tush, see the documentation
under ../dev/).

For a template, take a look at the model 'test_0001_tush'. 
There exists a specific 'makefileNWtush' which takes relative paths and also 
uses the core src folder (not a copy). In the "regular" workflow some of the
tcl scripts would be used internally to copy the files and prepare the makefile.
We do not want to use this here, deliberately.
