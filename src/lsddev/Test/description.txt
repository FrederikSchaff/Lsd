# Test models.

In this place you will find models that test the LSD Macro language.

The models herein serve two issues. Firstly, they are kind of a living 
documentation of how certain language features (especially Macros) work.
Secondly, they include specific test-logs, which can be used to confirm 
that the language does what it is suppossed to do. This allows automatic
regression testing (using a simple tool caleld tush, see the documentation
under ../dev/).

For a template, take a look at the model 'test_0001_tush'. 
There exists a specific test makefile 'makefileNWtush' in this folder, which 
is called from the tush test scripts. It differs from regular makefiles, 
for example it uses the core src folder (not a copy), reducing the time when 
compiling new tests to basically compiling the new file(s) and linking them. 

Lets take the example of the first test model (which does nothing but run 3 steps..)
You can call the makefile as follows (piping stdout to a trash file):

$ cd .. && make -f makefileNWtush MODEL=test_0001_tush TCL_VERSION=8.6 >> tushLogNull.log

And then you can run the model with:

# Building or manually runing test models
In the "regular" workflow some of the tcl scripts would be used internally 
to copy the files and prepare the makefile. If you want to run a test model,
the easiest is to copy the complete Test folder into the core LSD folder and
browse it via LSD. Missing files (like makefile) will be generated automatically.
