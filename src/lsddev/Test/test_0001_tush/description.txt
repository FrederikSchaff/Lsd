Model Test_0001_tush (ver. 1.0)

# Description
This testmodel is a meta-test model. Its purpose is to test the utilities
that are used within the tush tests.

# Tush Test procedure
In all cases, we need to go one folder up (leaving the temporary tush folder)

Firstly, we make the specific no window version if it was not already created (i.e. only in single run)

# Get the model name which is the name of the temporary dir (not the path, only the dir)
# Note: This is test code here. We cannot assign it to a variable here as each $ is a new shell.
$ cd .. && echo $(pwd | grep -oP '^.*\/\K(\w*)')
| test_0001_tush

# Compile the executable - looks complicated, but you never need to change it...
#$ cd .. && { [ -e lsdTush ] &&  { echo "executable already exists" >> tushLogNull.log } || { modelName=$(pwd | grep -oP '^.*\/\K(\w*)') && cd .. && make -f makefileNWtush MODEL=$modelName >> $modelName/tushLogNull.log } }
$ cd .. && modelName=$(pwd | grep -oP '^.*\/\K(\w*)') && cd .. && $( make -f makefileNWtush MODEL=$modelName >> $modelName/tushLogNull.log )

Secondly, we run the tushTest.lsd and expect it to not fail. Important: Pipe stdout to a trash file, to ignore it.
Otherwise you would, e.g., include timing issues.
$ cd .. && ./lsdTush -f tushTest.lsd >> tushLogNull.log

Thirdly, we compare the output with the expected output. Here we use tush explicitly.
$ cd .. && cat tushTestLog.log
