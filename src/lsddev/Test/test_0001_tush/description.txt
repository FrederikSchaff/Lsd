Model Test_0001_tush (ver. 1.0)

# Description
This testmodel is a meta-test model. Its purpose is to test the utilities
that are used within the tush tests.

# Tush Test procedure
In all cases, we need to go one folder up (leaving the temporary tush folder)

## Preparation
Firstly, we make the specific no window version if it was not already created (i.e. only in single run)

Get the model name which is the name of the temporary dir (not the path, only the dir)
Note: This is test code here. We cannot assign it to a variable here as each $ is a new shell.
$ cd .. && echo $(pwd | grep -oP '^.*\/\K(\w*)')
| test_0001_tush

### Create the special no window makefile.
Step 1: Copy content from makefile-tush-settings.txt
$ cd .. && cat ../makefile-tush-settings.txt > makefileNW

Step 2: Exchange 'MODEL=' with the dir name / model name
$ cd .. && modelName=$(pwd | grep -oP '^.*\/\K(\w*)') && sed -i s/MODEL=/MODEL=$modelName/g makefileNW

Step 3: Append the file with the content of the makefile-NW.txt
$ cd .. && cat ../../../makefile-NW.txt >> makefileNW

### Compile the executable - but do not consider std output of compilation in this test
$ cd .. && if [ -f lsdNW ]; then rm lsdNW; fi
$ cd .. && make -f makefileNW >> tushLogNull.log


## Run Model
Secondly, we run the tushTest.lsd and expect it to not fail. Important: Pipe stdout to a trash file, to ignore it.
Otherwise you would, e.g., include timing issues.
$ cd .. && ./lsdNW -f tushTest.lsd >> tushLogNull.log

## Validate Results
Thirdly, we compare the output with the expected output. Here we use tush explicitly.
$ cd .. && cat tushTestLog.log
